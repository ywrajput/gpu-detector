### 4. Heroku (Paid)

1. **Install Heroku CLI**
   ```bash
   # macOS
   brew install heroku/brew/heroku
   ```

2. **Deploy**
   ```bash
   heroku login
   heroku create your-gpu-detector-app
   git add .
   git commit -m "Ready for deployment"
   git push heroku main
   ```

## Environment Variables

For production, you might want to set:
- `FLASK_ENV=production`
- `PORT=8080` (some platforms set this automatically)

## Testing Your Deployment

After deployment, test these endpoints:
- `https://your-app-url.com/` - Main page
- `https://your-app-url.com/api/detect` - API endpoint
- `https://your-app-url.com/api/health` - Health check

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Import Errors**: Make sure all dependencies are in `requirements.txt`
2. **Port Issues**: Some platforms set PORT environment variable
3. **Timeout**: GPU detection might timeout on some platforms

### Debug Mode:
- Set `FLASK_ENV=development` for debug output
- Check platform logs for error messages

## Security Notes

- The app doesn't store any user data
- All detection happens client-side
- No sensitive information is transmitted

## Performance

- The app is lightweight and should work well on free tiers
- GPU detection might be slower on some platforms
- Consider adding caching if you get high traffic
